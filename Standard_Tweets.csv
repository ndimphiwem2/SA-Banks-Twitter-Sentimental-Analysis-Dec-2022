2022-12-27 11:01:15+00:00,giftbm,@StandardBankZA That’s the maximum and it’s controlled by Standard Bank. Pay and Clear prices the greed of the banks that the service meant to be available as standard you charge it at premium. Capitec &amp; Bank Zero their normal transfer clears either same day but at most the following day.

We would also like to highlight that Monday and today are public holidays, not working days.
